#	This is a virtual server that handles ARP.
#
#	It allows the administrator to log ARP packets on the
#	local network.  The idea is that the ARP packets can be
#	checked against a database (e.g. DHCP), or stored in
#	an ARP-specific database.  If something funny is
#	going on, it can produce syslog messages informing the
#	administrator.
#
#	See "arpwatch" for examples of what it should do.   For now,
#	this is just a toy example.
#
#	It NEVER sends an ARP packet.

server arp {
	listen {
		#
		#  ARP is type arp.
		#
		type = arp

		#
		#  The only configuration possible for ARP
		#  is the name of the interface.

		interface = en1

	#
	#  And the REAL contents.  This section is just like the
	#  "post-auth" section of radiusd.conf.  In fact, it calls the
	#  "post-auth" component of the modules that are listed here.
	#  But it's called "arp" to highlight that it's for ARP.
	#
	#  If you need to know the interface, use %{listen:interface}
	#

		ok
